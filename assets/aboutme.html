Probably the happiest time of our lives. Many consider their college lives to be the best, but to me high school is better, because it has more fun and less workload. It marks the time when we have just shed our baby skins and we are coming into our bodies. We are young adults now. Our bodies are going through a series of changes.</p> <p> Boys are transforming into young men, while girls are blooming into beautiful young women. At this point, we are mature enough to recognize our interests, our passions and everything else we need to know about ourselves.</p></td>
