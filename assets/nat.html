                    <p>By the end of the 19th century, European powers had carved up almost all of Africa after the Berlin Conference. Only Ethiopia—then still commonly known as Abyssinia—and the Republic of Liberia still maintained their independence (Liberia being a settler nation supported by the United States).</p>
                    <p>The Battle of Adwa (also called Adowa and Adua) was fought over two days (1st / 2nd March) between Ethiopian forces under Emperor Menelik II and invading Italian forces, and was the deciding battle in the First Italo-Ethiopian war and a turning point in modern African history with a European Colonial power being defeated and Ethiopia being recognised as a sovereign nation state by the European powers. </p>

                    <p>Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, is a rugged, landlocked country split by the Great Rift Valley. With archaeological finds dating back more than 3 million years, it’s a place of ancient culture. Among its important sites are Lalibela with its rock-cut Christian churches from the 12th–13th centuries. Aksum is the ruins of an ancient city with obelisks, tombs, castles and Our Lady Mary of Zion church.</p>
                    <p>Ethiopia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites. No African country has more United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) sites than Ethiopia. UNESCO recognizes and protects sites of globally significant, cultural or natural heritage value. In Ethiopia, 8 are cultural,one is natural - the Simien Mountains National Park,three intangible heritages</p>
                    <p>If I am tired, I chose some calm, relaxing songs. Music can speak, through music people can express feelings and emotions. When you hear something that looks like you, that you understand it easily, you start to love it. There are several different ways to enjoy music as your hobby.</p>
